# Learning GraphQL

Code examples created while learning GraphQL with Node.js, React and Apollo.

Almost all of the code based on the [GraphQL course](https://www.udemy.com/course/graphql-with-react-course) by [Stephen Grider](https://github.com/stephengrider) on Udemy.com with some changes done by me.
